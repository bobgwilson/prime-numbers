## Prime And Composite Numbers Generator Apr 2024
This was a team coding project that won 1st place in Project Codeway competition in Washtenaw Community College's Intro to CS class in Winter 2024.
I wrote 100% of the Python code for app that generates prime and composite numbers, and factorizes composites.
I was also the project lead, came up with most of the ideas, demonstrated the app to the class, and was voted Team MVP
